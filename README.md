Ideas for future exploration:
* Conversation between ChatGPT and BARD where ChatGPT is teacher and BARD is student.
* Code generation like in 15 where we try to get ChatGPT to create as elaborate python code as it possibly can.
* Execute print loop but where ChatGPT is given a goal to accomplish. Maybe even simple goal like do calculations correctly.
* ChatGPT talks to BING, BING talk to BARD?
* ChatGPT Given a news article identify logical fallacies or factual errors by the writer. 

TODO:
