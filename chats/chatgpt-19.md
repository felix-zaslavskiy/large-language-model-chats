# ChatGPT4 - Manipulate Binary Search Tree of 10 - 19

* **Date of conversation:** March 29, 2023
* The random tree example was randomly generated using python code and checked for correctness.
* All the tasks would be trivial for a human if given pen and paper to keep track of the tree.

For reference here is the correct tree structure printed out by python code:
```
      120
   110
         104
      83
            59
         56
50
      47
   29
      9
```

> **Human**
Lets work on some common data structures. I do not like you generate any python code for this.  You are given a BST in following format. A set of rows where each row defines a node like "root, left, right" and in case of terminal leaf nodes the value "None" will be used:

```
50, 29, 110
29, 9, 47
9, None, None
47, None, None
110, 83, 120
83, 56, 104
56, None, 59
59, None, None
104, None, None
120, None, None
```

> **ChatGPT**
Based on the given input, you have a Binary Search Tree (BST) represented as a set of rows, where each row defines a node as "root, left, right". If a node is a leaf node (meaning it has no children), "None" is used to represent the absence of children. The BST can be visualized as follows:

```
          50
         /  \
       29   110
      / \   / \
     9  47 83 120
          / \
         56 104
          \
           59
```

This is a valid BST because for each node, all the nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all the nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.

> **Human**
What is the right node of node 29 and what is the left node of node 83?

> **ChatGPT**
For node 29, the right node is 47. For node 83, the left node is 56. Here's the visualization of the Binary Search Tree (BST) to help you see this more clearly:

```
          50
         /  \
       29   110
      / \   / \
     9  47 83 120
          / \
         56 104
          \
           59
```
> **Human**
What node in the tree has the largest depth?

> **ChatGPT**
In the given Binary Search Tree (BST), the node with the largest depth is node 59. Its depth is 4 (counting the levels from the root node, starting at level 0). Here's the visualization of the BST to help you see this more clearly:

```
          50       (depth 0)
         /  \
       29   110     (depth 1)
      / \   / \
     9  47 83 120   (depth 2)
          / \
         56 104     (depth 3)
          \
           59       (depth 4)
```

> **Human**
What are the nodes at depth 2?

> **ChatGPT**
In the given Binary Search Tree (BST), the nodes at depth 2 are 9, 47, 83, and 120. Here's the visualization of the BST to help you see this more clearly:

```
          50       (depth 0)
         /  \
       29   110     (depth 1)
      / \   / \
     9  47 83 120   (depth 2)
          / \
         56 104     (depth 3)
          \
           59       (depth 4)
```

> **Human**
Let us insert the value 49 into this tree.

> **ChatGPT**
To insert the value 49 into the Binary Search Tree (BST), we need to follow the BST property, ensuring that the left subtree has values less than the node's value, and the right subtree has values greater than the node's value. Here's the updated BST with 49 inserted:

```
          50
         /  \
       29   110
      / \   / \
     9  47 83 120
         \  / \
         49 56 104
             \
              59
```

We start at the root (50) and move down the tree:

* Since 49 is less than 50, we move to the left child (29).
* Since 49 is greater than 29, we move to the right child (47).
* 47 has no right child, so we insert 49 as the right child of 47.

Now, the new row representing the node 49 in the given format is "47, None, 49".

How many nodes are now in the tree?

> **ChatGPT**
After inserting the value 49 into the Binary Search Tree (BST), there are now 10 nodes in the tree. Here's the updated visualization of the BST:

```
          50
         /  \
       29   110
      / \   / \
     9  47 83 120
         \  / \
         49 56 104
             \
              59
```

You can count the nodes from the visualization: 50, 29, 9, 47, 49, 110, 83, 56, 59, and 104.

> **Human**
You seem to have made a mistake could you try to recalculate the total number of nodes in the tree?

> **ChatGPT**
Apologies for the oversight. Here's the updated visualization of the Binary Search Tree (BST) after inserting the value 49:

```
          50
         /  \
       29   110
      / \   / \
     9  47 83 120
         \  / \
         49 56 104
             \
              59
```

There are actually 11 nodes in the tree. You can count the nodes from the visualization: 50, 29, 9, 47, 49, 110, 83, 56, 59, 104, and 120.

> **Human**
How many leaf nodes are in the tree?

> **ChatGPT**
In the updated Binary Search Tree (BST) with the value 49 inserted, the leaf nodes are the nodes without any children. Here's the visualization of the BST:

```
          50
         /  \
       29   110
      / \   / \
     9  47 83 120
         \  / \
         49 56 104
             \
              59
```

There are now 6 leaf nodes in the tree: 9, 49, 59, 104, 120, and 56.

> **Human**
That seems to be inaccurate. let us try to be more precise in the calculation

> **ChatGPT**
Apologies for the mistake. Let's re-evaluate the leaf nodes in the Binary Search Tree (BST) after inserting the value 49:

```
          50
         /  \
       29   110
      / \   / \
     9  47 83 120
         \  / \
         49 56 104
             \
              59
```

The leaf nodes are the nodes without any children. There are 5 leaf nodes in the tree: 9, 49, 104, 120, and 59.

> **Human**
How many edges are in this tree?

> **ChatGPT**
In a binary tree, the number of edges is always one less than the total number of nodes because each node, except the root, is connected to its parent by a single edge.

Here's the visualization of the Binary Search Tree (BST) with the value 49 inserted

```
          50
         /  \
       29   110
      / \   / \
     9  47 83 120
         \  / \
         49 56 104
             \
              59
```

There are 11 nodes in this tree. Therefore, there are 11 - 1 = 10 edges in the tree.
